Here you can find my project on cleaning statcast data. Be aware this is an Ipython file created using Jupyter Notebook, and some of the functionality (linked table of contents, some headers, and images) is currently lost when not opened in Jupyter Notebook or Lab.

Contents:<br />
  -Cleaning Stastcast Data.ipynb is the main project file, found [here](https://github.com/chrisman1015/Cleaning-Statcast-Data/blob/master/Cleaning%20Statcast%20Data/Cleaning%20Statcast%20Data.ipynb). [Using nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrisman1015/Cleaning-Statcast-Data/blob/master/Cleaning%20Statcast%20Data/Cleaning%20Statcast%20Data.ipynb#2.3) <br />
  -Rough Draft contains sections I haven't yet completed<br />
  -graphics contains the images I'm including in the guide. Sources for the images have not yet been cited, but I don't own them and they'll be cited in the final draft<br />
  -listb and apa.csl are used for auto citations. These will produce the bibliography in the final draft
